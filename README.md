# In-it-For-Good
program files for IIFG project

This is primarily where we keep the master syntax file for variable construction for the IIFG project.
Collaborators adding variables should create a branch from the master syntax file to work on and then submit the new variable.
It will be included in the master syntax file when the project PIs approve the construction.
