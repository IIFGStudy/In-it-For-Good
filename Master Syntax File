#MASTER SYNTAX FILE FOR SPSS CODE FOR CONSTRUCTING VARIABLES FOR IIFG PROJECT.

COMMENT CONSTRUCT THE RACE VARIABLE.
COMMENT THIS APPROACH ASSIGNS RACE FROM MOST NUMEROUS TO LEAST NUMEROUS CATEGORY.
COMMENT WHITE HISPANIC ASIAN BLACK NATIVE AMERICAN THEN OTHER.
COMMENT LESS NUMEROUS CATEGORIES OVERWRITE MORE NUMEROUS CATEGORIES WHERE MULTIPLE OPTIONS ARE CHECKED.
COMMENT THIS MAXIMIZES SIZE OF RACIAL CATEGORIES FOR ANALYSIS.
COMMENT OTHER IS ALLOWED TO OVERWRITE ALL CATEGORIES THAT PRECEED IT.

USE all.

COMMENT CONSTRUCT THE RACE2 VARIABLE.
COMMENT THIS APPROACH ASSIGNS RACE FROM MOST NUMEROUS TO LEAST NUMEROUS CATEGORY.
COMMENT OTHER WHITE HISPANIC ASIAN BLACK NATIVE AMERICAN.
COMMENT LESS NUMEROUS CATEGORIES OVERWRITE MORE NUMEROUS CATEGORIES WHERE MULTIPLE OPTIONS ARE CHECKED.
COMMENT THIS MAXIMIZES SIZE OF RACIAL CATEGORIES FOR ANALYSIS.
COMMENT BECAUSE OTHER PRECEDES ALL CATEGORIES MORE SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OVERWRITE IT.
