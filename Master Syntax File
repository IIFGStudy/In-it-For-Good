COMMENT CREATE DEBT VARIABLES.
COMMENT DONE FOR CHICAGO PRESENTATION MARCH 2017.

document Three Variables Created: ED_DEBT_ENTER, ED_DEBT_GRAD, ED_DEBT_TOTAL.

* Source raw 2017 data.

* Create variable in numeric format for educational debt upon entering law school.
string ED_DEBT_ENTER (A13).

Variable labels 
ED_DEBT_ENTER Total educational debt when entering law school. 
execute.
value labels ED_DEBT_ENTER

* Create variable in numeric format for educational debt upon leaving law school.
* This variable adds debt entering law school to debt accumulated during law school.
* created by Mark Leinauer 2/23/2017. 
* Note that, given the language of and q25 this assumes no payment of previous debt (q24).
* during law school - it also may not take into account interest accumulated during law school. 
* It is not, therefore, an exact measure of debt burden upon leaving law school.
